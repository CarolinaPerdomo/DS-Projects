- Context: Despite a majority of customer retention, a significant number of churned customers prompted a deeper analysis to understand underlying causes and patterns.

- Task: Analyze customer data to identify key factors influencing churn, such as pricing, tenure, contract type, services, and payment methods, and develop a predictive model for future churn predictions.

- Action: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations, statistical tests, and feature importance evaluations. Developed a decision tree model to predict customer churn based on identified significant features.

- Result: Unearthed pivotal insights on early customer churn, the influence of contract types, and challenges with certain services and payment methods. Recommendations were provided to enhance customer experience, optimize contract offerings, and address specific challenges faced by segments like senior citizens.
