- Context: Analyzed a medical dataset containing records of individuals with various health metrics to understand their relationship with diabetes outcomes.

- Task: Developed a Feedforward Neural Network to predict diabetes outcomes based on medical predictor variables, while addressing data quality issues and optimizing model performance.

- Action: Conducted exploratory data analysis, employed statistical tests, handled missing values, and tuned the neural network model using various hyperparameters to enhance its predictive accuracy.

- Result: Achieved an average model accuracy of approximately 77% through cross-validation, providing insights into the significance of features like Glucose and BMI in predicting diabetes outcomes.
